# Olve Trains UI

[See AGENTS.md for repository guidelines.](./AGENTS.md)

This project is a vanilla TypeScript web application for viewing server logs and running commands. Source files live in `src/` and are bundled into `public/dist/` by esbuild.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Build the project with `npm run build`.
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.

The dev server watches for changes and serves the `public/` directory.
